# CS61A-Projects

This Repository includes all the projects that I've done in CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs at UC Berkeley in Fall 2021. We did 4 projects: 

1. HogProject - In The Game of Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points.

2. Cats - Inspired by typeracer (https://play.typeracer.com), CS 61A Autocorrected Typing Software is a project that measures typing speed and typing autocorrect (which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it)

3. Ants - Inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies (https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/popcap/plants-vs-zombies), Ants Vs. SomeBees is a tower defence game  where as the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath.
